Method 1:
adjacent()
This method used two points and determined whether or not these points were next to each other. 
I chose to put this in the Point class to eliminate one parameter, and because it made logical sense.
However, I could also see it being reasonably left in the Functions class, as it is fairly general Math.

Method 2:
withinBounds()
This method uses a considerable amount of data from both the Point class as well as the WorldModel class.
I eventually decided on the WorldModel class, but it could also be argued that this should go in the 
Point class. Thinking about calling this, p.withinBounds(world) makes sense, as does world.withinBounds(p).
Now that I think about it, the former makes possibly more sense.

Method 3:
loadImages()
I eventually decided to put this method inside ImageStore, as to me that is where it logically made sense, 
and it did use an ImageStore object a few times. However, as this is a reasonably general function (like load), 
I'd say this could have arguably been left as a static method in the Functions class.
